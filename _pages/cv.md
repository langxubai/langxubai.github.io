Education
======
* B.S. in School of Physics, Nankai University,  from 2021

Research Experience
======
* Investigating Stochastic Quantum Signal Processing, [Prof. Yuan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5EGClVoAAAAJ),  Electrical & Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University , Summer 2024
  * Github University

* Investigating Presence and Absence of Barren Plateaus in Quantum Fisher Kernel [Prof. Li-Wei Yu](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5849-4029) , Chern Institute of Mathematics, Nankai University , 2023
  * Focused on the Barren Plateaus phenomenon in quantum fisher kernel algorithm in Matrix Product State systems.
  * Encountered the Barren Plateaus phenomenon, where the training of quantum neural networks is impeded due to the vanishing of both the mean and variance of the loss function's gradient. 
  * Utilized the quantum Fisher kernel algorithm to compute the mean and variance corresponding to the Matrix Product State model under both local and global loss functions to assess whether the Barren Plateau phenomenon persists.  

* Investigating Tensor Networks Algorithms in Quantum Physics and Machine Learning , [Prof. Pan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=MFnbrRUAAAAJ) , Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Summer 2023
  * Mastered the fundamentals of tensor networks theory, encompassing tensor decompositions such as Canonical Polyadic Decomposition, Tucker Decomposition, and Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition.
  * Gained proficiency in Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithms, infinite DMRG, and a foundational understanding of tensor network construction and its diverse applications in quantum physics and machine learning.
  * Acquired relevant skills in programming tools and software to classically simulate quantum processors efficiently using ITensor(C++) and JuliaTensor (Julia).
