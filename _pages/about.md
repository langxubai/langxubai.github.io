This is Langxu's new home on the web! It is still under construction, and some details are waiting to be filled in, but you can already get most of the information about me.

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Physics at [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/), currently visiting [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) as part of the [QUEST group]([https://](https://yuanliu.group/)) under the supervision of [Dr. Yuan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5EGClVoAAAAJ). I have previously worked as a research assistant intern at [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/), [Institute of Theoretical Physics CAS](https://itp.cas.cn/), and [Institute of Physics CAS](https://iop.cas.cn/). My research interests lie in Quantum Signal Processing, Quantum Machine Learning, and spin models in the context of Quantum Information Theory.

My academic journey has been driven by a profound curiosity to understand the fundamental laws of the universe. I have built a solid foundation in mathematics and physics, honing my analytical and problem-solving skills through rigorous hands-on experiences. I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research, foster innovation, and collaborate with fellow scientists to expand the frontiers of human knowledge.
