This is Steven's TEST home on the web! 

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Physics at Nankai University, currently visiting North Carolina State University as part of the QUEST group under the supervision of Dr. Yuan Liu. I have previously worked as a research assistant intern at Nankai University, the Institute of Theoretical Physics CAS, and the Institute of Physics CAS. My research interests lie in Quantum Signal Processing, Quantum Machine Learning, and spin models in the context of Quantum Information Theory.

My academic journey has been driven by a profound curiosity to understand the fundamental laws of the universe. I have built a solid foundation in mathematics and physics, honing my analytical and problem-solving skills through rigorous hands-on experiences. I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research, foster innovation, and collaborate with fellow scientists to expand the frontiers of human knowledge.
